# Development Plan: Content Synchronization Tool

## Tool Description
A content synchronization tool that ensures the content in the root directory and the `httpdocs` directory are identical. This tool will prevent inconsistencies and errors caused by having duplicate content in different locations.

## Core Features
1.  **File Comparison:** Compare files in the root directory and `httpdocs` directory based on their content.
2.  **Difference Identification:** Identify files that are different or missing in either directory.
3.  **File Synchronization:** Copy files from one directory to another to ensure they are identical.
4.  **New File Handling:** Detect new files in either directory and copy them to the other.
5.  **Logging:** Log all actions performed by the tool, including file comparisons, synchronizations, and new file detections.
6.  **Configuration:** Allow users to specify which directories to synchronize via a configuration file.

## Implementation Details
1.  **Language:** Python (due to existing `seo_scanner.py` script).
2.  **File Comparison:** Use a hash-based comparison (e.g., SHA256) to efficiently compare file contents.
3.  **Directory Traversal:** Use `os.walk` to recursively traverse directories.
4.  **Configuration File:** Use a JSON or YAML file to store directory paths to synchronize.
5.  **Logging:** Use Python's `logging` module to log actions to a file.

## Potential Future Extensions
1.  **Support for more directories:** Allow users to specify multiple directories to synchronize.
2.  **Two-way synchronization:** Implement two-way synchronization, where changes in either directory are reflected in the other.
3.  **Conflict resolution:** Implement a mechanism to handle file conflicts (e.g., prompt user to choose which version to keep).
4.  **Real-time synchronization:** Implement real-time synchronization using file system events.
5.  **GUI:** Create a graphical user interface for the tool.

## Next Steps
1.  Create a basic Python script for the content synchronization tool.
2.  Implement the core features (file comparison, difference identification, file synchronization).
3.  Add logging and configuration options.
4.  Test the tool thoroughly.
