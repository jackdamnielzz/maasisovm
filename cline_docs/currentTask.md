# Current Task: Review Project and Suggest Custom Tool

## Task Description
Review the entire project and suggest a custom tool that could be built to improve the project.

## Analysis
The project appears to be a website with standard HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some PHP files. There's also an SEO scanner and a `cline_docs` directory for documentation. The `httpdocs` directory seems to be a duplicate of the root directory, which is unusual and could lead to inconsistencies.

## Proposed Custom Tool
A content synchronization tool that ensures the content in the root directory and the `httpdocs` directory are identical. This tool would prevent inconsistencies and errors caused by having duplicate content in different locations. This tool could also be extended to handle other directories in the future.

## Next Steps
1. Create a more detailed plan for the content synchronization tool.
2. Document the plan in `cline_docs/development_plan.md`.
